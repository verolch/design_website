            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Context</h3>
            <p class="project-text"><a href="http://tiendanube.com">Tiendanube</a> is an Argentinian Startup that empowers thousands of brands to achieve their full potential by providing them with an online store and all the tools to manage their online operation. </p>
            <p class="project-text">At the time of this project, the company had grown a lot. The service it provided had improved and bigger brands were joining as clients. But the public perception was that it was a product for people just starting to sell online, and we needed a new way to position our selves in the market. </p>
            <p class="project-text">The decision was made to rebrand the company, and an external agency was hired to make this happen. While internally, the product design team, kept working on features and delivering value to our users.</p>     
        </div>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">The goal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="project-text"> Position ourselves differently in the market and earn the trust of small and big business.</li>
                <li class="project-text"> Align the design with the technical growth of our service.</li>
                <li class="project-text"> Improve the experience of our clients everyday operations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Team & Role</h3>
            <p class="project-text">I led the design strategy and implementation, working alongside 2 designers, a product manager, a product engineer, and the QA team. While still being a hand on contributor, my main role was supporting the team through:
                <ul>
                    <li class="project-text">The research process</li>
                    <li class="project-text">Defining the scope</li>
                    <li class="project-text">Designing the UI and UX</li>
                    <li class="project-text">Validation and Testing</li>
                    <li class="project-text">Implementing the frontend. </li>
                </ul>  
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Approach</h3>
            <p class="project-text">Deliver an improved Admin experience, scoped within the timeline of the wider company rebranding</p>
        </div>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Research - Undestanding our users</h3>
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Method:  Interviews</p>
            <p class="project-text">We dived into really understanding the relationship between our users and the admin panel.Our goal was to understand:
                <ul>
                    <li class="project-text">How was the current navigation working for them?</li>
                    <li class="project-text">Where could we improve?</li>
                    <li class="project-text">What were the most used sections? </li>
                    <li class="project-text">Were these the easiest to access?</li>
                </ul>     
            </p>
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Learnings:</p>
            <p class="project-text">We discovered that a lot of our user's pain points had to do with some features being hard to find, especially as a first-time user. But even the more seasoned users sometimes had trouble remembering how to perform everyday tasks on the platform. They even had some of our tutorials bookmarked.</p>
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Method: Card Sorting</p>
            <p class="project-text">We needed to differentiate between people who were already using the platform (as they were biased and knew where things were) and people who were using it for the first time (trials).<br>Based on these learnings we designed a new menu structure and tested it with customers.</p>
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Method: Quantitive data on amplitude.</p>
            <p class="project-text">We constantly checked the metrics provided by the tool to understand users click and flow.</p>
            <div class="m-t-2em col-md-12 p-0">

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Validating the new structure</h3>
            <p class="project-text">We sent out many tasks to our clients using a tool called Maze. We wanted to compare the time spent on similar tasks in the old structure vs. the new.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-12 p-0">
            <img src="img/verolch.com/admin-maze.png" alt="" class="img-responsive center-img" />

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Implementation</h3>
            <p class="project-text">Paralell to the implementation of the design we worked on an adoption strategy for the new admin using an opt-in methodology</p>
        </div>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">

            <p class="caption">Opt-in modal with slider explaining they could go back to the old version.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Transitioning to the new structure.</p>
            <p class="project-text">At this stage, we still didn't know what the final image of the rebranding was going to look like. So our focus was on understanding how to organize the information.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Apply new branding</p>
            <p class="project-text">After the brand guide arrived and we could start applying it, we did it directly on this new structure.<br>
            We started by applying the new colours and typography.<br>
            Next, we moved on to adjusting the margins and spacing. This allowed us to align with the concepts of the brand guide: Excellence, performance, human.</p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Cutting scope</p>
            <p class="project-text">The admin has 26 sections, each with its own internal screens. Each screen has its own custom functionality with multiple states. Depending on the use case, each admin section also has many visual states. For example, lots of products, some products, empty (no products). success & error states, etc...<br>
            For a team of three people, it was a huge task. I helped the team create a strategy that would have the most impact on our goal while still being achievable.<br>
            We focused on the navigation of each one of these sections, and on the sections most used by merchants within the platform. These were the Product and Order sections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Validation & Testing</h3>
            <p class="m-t-2em project-subtitle-2">Test with allied users & internal teams</p>
            <p class="project-text">When you make such a big change to a platform you are bound to break things. The idea was for the new brand to generate trust and demonstrate excellence. We wanted to cause a positive emotion, without interfering in users' day-to-day.</p>
            <p class="project-text">We gathered detailed feedback from allied users, the customer support team, and QA</p>
            <p class="project-text">We prioritised feedback in categories allowing us to tackle the most pressing issues before the release. We had categories such as: 
                - UX improvements
                - Critical bugs
                - UX bugs</p>

            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Learnings</h3>
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Importance of cutting scope & focus on the bigger battles.</p>
            <p class="project-text">As long as we kept adding things and wanted to solve everything together, we extended the development time. We knew we were moving forward, but nothing was getting through to the client.</p>
            <p class="project-text">To add value we had to let go of our "designer ego" where everything must be perfect before anyone sees it, and instead start generating value for our users.</p>
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Aligning with other teams and talking things through when there is a disagreement.</p>
            <p class="project-text">We had a different understanding of what QA meant for this project. This was apparent when reviewing the bugs that were raised. This was causing frustration for the designers in my team. We got together with the QA team to solve it.</p>
            <p class="project-subtitle-2">Keep asking questions.</p>
            <p class="project-text">Generating value also means taking into account that no matter how much research we have done on how to improve our admin experience, the reality is that nobody likes to change. Sometimes we will still get things wrong and that is why contant feedback and a close conection to the people using the product is so important.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Continuous improvement</h3>
            <p class="project-text">After the release of the project and solving the most pressing issues, we could focus on further improvement. Helping to improve the experience and usability while leveraging our brand and identity.</p>
            <p class="project-text">My team was longing to have some more fun with the new identity too. We created new illustrations for the empty states. Redesigned Font-awesome icons into custom ones and kept customising screens and states that didn't make it into the initial release scope. </p>
