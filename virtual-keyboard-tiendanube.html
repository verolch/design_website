            <p class="project-text"> Tiendanube is a digital product that empowers more than 27000 brands in Latin America with the tools to setup, manage and promote their business easily and from any device. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h3 class="project-subtitle">The Problem</h3>
            <p class="project-text">Tiendanube's merchants use social networks and messaging apps to promote and grow their audiences. The message flow they receive every day through this media is increasing, making it difficult to manage all their customers questions. The challenge was to help them optimize this interactions.

            <h3 class="project-subtitle">Solution</h3>
            <p class="project-text"> We designed and developed a new functionality for our mobile app that allows users to enable a virtual keyboard, accesible from any app, where they can choose between the products on their store and send their clients a quick link without leaving the app.

            <p class="project-text"> How might we empower merchants interactions with their clients and help them save time?</p>
            <p class="project-subtitle-alt">Interviews</p>
            <p class="project-text">
            We sent a recruiting email to users in our database that had recently shared products directly from our mobile app or that had a great ammount of instagram followers. The interviews where scripted but open. We weren't trying to get presice answers to our questions but to understand everything around their daily communication with their clients, going deep in the why and how they were doing things.</p> 
        </div>
    </div>
    <img src="img/research.jpg" class="full-width">
    <p class="caption">We created a board with every insight and use themed columns to understand where the main problems and opportunities where.</p>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <p class="project-subtitle-alt">Surveys</p>
            <p class="project-text">
                We created a survey based on our interviews findings to validate this with a broader ammount of users, and see what else we could learn in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
                We learned a lot on this phase. This are the most relevant insights:</p> 
            <ul>
            <li class="project-text">Answering clients questions is one of the merchants main operational timewasters</li>
            <li class="project-text">Merchants see a great value when customers visit their store vs achieving a purchase directly in the chat</li>
            <li class="project-text">It's hard to send links of their products to clientes</li>
            <li class="project-text">They’re continually typing the same texts for answering</li>
            <li class="project-text">Whatsapp works like a trust validator and strenghten the link between merchants and their clients. Other communications tools, such as instagram, email or messenger, do not have the same impact.</li>
            </ul>

        The kind of informations more requested by consumers is about the products, followed by shipping methods and payments.

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <p class="project-text">We focus our solution on creating a faster way for merchants to send product links to their clients. We explored two main roads:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="project-text">
                    Creating an easy accesible way of sharing products inside Tiendanube's mobile app (sketches on the right)
                </li>
                <li class="project-text">Creating a virtual keyboard where merchants could share products without leaving the app (sketches on the left)</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="m-t-2em col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <p class="project-text">We validated this ideas really fast with our merchants in residence -we have actual Tiendanube's clients working on our offices, I would love to tell you more about this so feel free to ask me about it anytime! -.<br>
            We realized that the implementation of the first idea, was very low hanging for our development team to implement and decided to go for it... while we worked on the second one.

            Then we moved on to a high quality prototype to test. We contacted the same merchants we had interviewed in our research via Whatsapp call and send them the prototype to get their feedback. The response was better that what we had antcipated!
            They loved the feature and they wanted to know when they could start using it! 
            It’s not everyday that you have such entusiastic responses to a proprotype sent by whatsapp so we were super excited too and felling that we where on the right path.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">This is what merchants were doing everytime they wanted to share a product during a conversation with a customer:</p>

            Once the keyboard is installed, you can access it from any app that has the posibilite to chat.
            You switch keyboards just as you would with any other language or emoji keyboard. Once you are using it, it has it's own navbar which you can tap to go back to your regular keyboard.
            We added a search bar and a product showcase scrollable bar. Also there is the option to send the link to your entire store as well.

            <h2>Building and testing the MVP</h2>
            <p class="project-text">
            The first version we were able to build with the development team didn't have the search bar as it was a challenge to access the online catalogue and index it each time a search was performed.<br>
            We started just with the product scrollable bar and activate it to some beta testers that had less than 30 products to see how much adoption it had and how much they used it in their day to day.<br>
            Then we were able to build the search bar for IOS and test it with more merchants. As we had invisioned, it proved to be a super valuable feature for stores with larger catalogues. We are still working on the implementation for android.

            Today the project is still in Beta. We are receiveing feedback and collecting day to day usage data.<br>This are the key metrics we are looking at:</p>

            While working on this project we identified that whatsapp was one of the main trust builders between the  merchants and their clients. In order to make this interaction more available we created an option for merchants to activate a whatsapp widget on their website via our platform business administrator.
